# MineX – DreamNet Character Agent Hackathon Submission

![MineX Banner](images/minex-banner.png)

> **Unlocking true ownership for 350&nbsp;million Minecraft players.**

MineX is a **Minecraft server project** that bridges Web2 gameplay with Web3 ownership and AI-driven storytelling. For the **DreamNet Character Agent Hackathon**, we integrated DreamNet’s webhook and API to add original, fun, and dynamic AI-powered interactions to an special story mode and throughout the map. MineX is not affiliated with DreamNet outside of this hackathon (yet).

## ✨ What is MineX?

MineX is a next-generation Minecraft server designed to:
- Unlock true digital asset ownership for players by integrating on-chain wallets and asset management.
- Provide a unique story-driven quest ("Digital Garden Rescue") with interactive NPCs and puzzles.
- Seamlessly blend traditional Minecraft gameplay with blockchain features and AI-generated narrative.
- Use DreamNet’s AI only for this hackathon to enhance Daisy’s character dialogue and quest flavor.

Players explore the map, interact with Daisy in story mode, and encounter AI-powered events and messages as part of the quest and in various locations.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### DreamNet Integration (for Hackathon)
- Our server hosts both an **API server** and a **webhook server** to communicate with DreamNet’s platform.
- Daisy’s in-game dialogue and certain quest messages are powered by DreamNet’s AI, using webhooks and API calls.
- Every interaction is designed to feel natural and immersive, leveraging DreamNet for creative, context-aware responses.

## 📂 Repository Contents

```
MineX/
├── src/                 # Plugin/server source (Java + YAML)
├── build.gradle         # Gradle build (Spigot API)
├── README.md            # You are here 🚀

We only publish the **plugin/server source**, not the full game world. Clone, build, drop the JAR into any 1.21.x Spigot/Paper server and go!
